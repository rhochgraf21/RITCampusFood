# RITCampusFood

[RIT CampusFood](campusfood.cs.house) is a simple website that displays the busyness of dining locations on the RIT campus.

## Usage

All of the project code that runs on the website is contained in the index.html file (just raw html/css/js).

The files lightmode.css and darkmode.css are for reference and are not used by the site.
